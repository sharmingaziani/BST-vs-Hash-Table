# Binary-Search-Tree

Hey guys! Welcome to one of the java projects I worked on in my Computer Science II class.

I implemented a Binary Search Tree to organize a data file containing author names, book titles, keywords, and themes to organize it in the most 
efficient way possible. 

This program reads in a user file and outputs all the data alphaetically organized using repeated keywords found in the datafile.txt
