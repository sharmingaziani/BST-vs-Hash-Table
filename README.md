## Some things about my project

I implemented a Binary Search Tree to efficiently organize a data file containing author names, book titles, keywords, and themes.

With this program, users can easily input their file and have it sorted alphabetically by utilizing repeated keywords found within the datafile.txt.

I used the same datafile.txt to test my program against my [HashTable Project](https://github.com/sharmingaziani/Hash-Table) for efficiency.
