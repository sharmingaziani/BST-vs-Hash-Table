# BST-vs-Hash-Table

Hey guys! Welcome to one of my java projects for my Computer Science II class.

I took two routes to solve a problem to see which one was the most optimal in the end using...
  1) Binary Search Tree
  2) Hash Table

I read in a data file containing author names, book titles, keywords, and themes trying to find the most efficient way to organize all the data as well as search for it later on.
