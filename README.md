# Binary-Search-Tree

Hey guys! Welcome to one of the java projects I worked on in my Computer Science II class.

I implemented a Binary Search Tree to efficiently organize a data file containing author names, book titles, keywords, and themes.

With this program, users can easily input their file and have it sorted alphabetically by utilizing repeated keywords found within the datafile.txt.
